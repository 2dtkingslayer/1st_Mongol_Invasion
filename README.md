## Inspiration
Finding mental health treatments can be difficult, especially in today's technologically advanced society with so many possibilities. If you've wanted to address a mental health issue but have been hesitant to do so in person, simple software that is meant to help you navigate your mental health journey and take the uncertainty out of obtaining the help you need.

## What it does

## How we built it
This project has been built with a lot of love, consideration to help others with their mental health and Python, using:
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Bootstrap Component](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com)
- [Calendar JS](https://github.com/jackducasse/caleandar)
- [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- SQLite

## Challenges we ran into
In our team, there's only one member that knows how to use flask and one other that knows how to use figma. It takes us a while to learn both of those to comprehensively create the website. This is also our first time to launch a project using API so it is not only challenging but also motivating.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned new technology like flask and figma. We also learned how to implement weather api into our website. By working closely at a team, we can achieve new goals in a short amount of time.
